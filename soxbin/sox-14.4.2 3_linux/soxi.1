.SH NAME
SoXI \- Sound eXchange Information, display sound file metadata
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsoxi\fR [\fB\-V\fR[\fIlevel\fR]] [\fB\-T\fR] [\fB\-t\fR\^|\^\fB\-r\fR\^|\^\fB\-c\fR\^|\^\fB\-s\fR\^|\^\fB\-d\fR\^|\^\fB\-D\fR\^|\^\fB\-b\fR\^|\^\fB\-B\fR\^|\^\fB\-p\fR\^|\^\fB\-e\fR\^|\^\fB\-a\fR] \fIinfile1\fR ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Displays information from the header of a given audio file or files.
Supported audio file types are listed and described in
.BR soxformat (7).
Note however, that
.B soxi
is intended for use only with audio files with a self-describing header.
.SP
By default, as much information as is available is shown.
An option may be given to select just a single piece of information
(perhaps for use in a script or batch-file).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-V\fR
Set verbosity. See
.BR sox (1)
for details.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR
Used with multiple files; changes the behaviour of
.BR \-s ,
.B \-d
and
.B \-D
to display the total across all given files.
Note that when used with
.B \-s
with files with different sampling rates, this is of questionable value.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR
Show detected file-type.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR
Show sample-rate.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR
Show number of channels.
.TP

\fB\-D\fR
Show duration in seconds (0 if unavailable).
.TP
\fB\-b\fR

.TP
\fB\-B\fR
